# 📂 File Sharing for Lern-Fair 📚

## 🔎 About
In this GitHub organization we are focusing on building a prototype for a better file-sharing system for [Lern-Fair](https://www.lern-fair.de/).
We aim to use [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) as a backend since it already has fully functioning file system and sharing functionalities and is open source. For our prototype, we will create a React Native app which will communicate with a NextCloud instance.
